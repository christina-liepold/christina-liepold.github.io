In my research, I focus mainly on:

**Combinatorial Auctions & Innovative Platform Applications**

In the realm of procurement auctions and general platform applications, I work on the analysis of the implementation of operational sharing processes and their impact on the overall market places. In particular, I focus on production capacity sharing in Production as a Service markets.

<br />

Other research interests revolve around **supply chain resilience** and optimization as well as **production planning**. Oftentimes, this research results from joint work together with students.

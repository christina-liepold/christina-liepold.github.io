**Welcome!**
  
<p>
  
  I am a PhD student and Research Assistant at the Professorship of Operations and Supply Chain Management at TUM School of Management. Previously, I completed the Master and Bachelor of Science in Management and Technology at TUM with a research stay at CIRRELT in Montréal, Canada, during my Master’s Thesis in 2020.

  My research focuses on auction theory and network optimization as well as their implementation within “as-a-Service”-applications.
